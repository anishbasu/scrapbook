<h1>Adjusting To Life Here</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
Living alone is hard. You know what's harder? Try living alone in a foreign country twelve thousand miles away from family. Although it is hard, for many people here at Drexel, it's a reality. I am one of those people. I had to leave my friends, my relatives, my parents, my city, my country to come here for a better future for myself. Sometimes you have to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to move ahead. You have to push yourself out of your comfort zone. 
</p>
<p>
	Adjusting to life here was an ordeal. I promised myself back in India that I'd return an adult. That means taking responsibilities for your actions, your health and wellbeing. Back in India I had parents to guide me. Although they call me on most days, it's really hard to condense all of your life's problems in an hour long phone call.

<h2>Lessons learnt after living here for 3 months</h2>

<h3>Never Convert Prices to Your Native Currency</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
	This one's a doozy. Everyone claims to not do this, yet this happens all the time. I'm guilty of doing this. I've caught myself doing this even when I'm buying a water bottle to quench my thirst. Yes, it's really sad that a dollar is sixty rupees, which is a lot, however you shouldn't starve yourself over the fact. It's useful to have a conservative estimate of how things will cost, so keep the price of your favorite item off the McDonald's dollar menu, and compare the prices of things you buy to that of the food. It's a much better estimate than convertig to your native currency and sighing that you cannot buy basic necessities because it's so expensive.
</p>
<h3>Never Miss Classes</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
	Well, this goes without saying. Classes in college are linked to each other, and if you miss one of them, you'll find yourself struggling to understand the concepts being taught in class the next day. Another thing that goes with this is managing your responsibilities. Allot specific times for doing specific tasks, and always keep extra time in case of an unexpected delay.
</p>
<h3>Make New Friends</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
	I can't stress how important this is. Make as many friends as you can, they're the most invaluable aspect college. Friends help you with homework, give you class notes, and help you catch up. Having friends is important, because humans are social animals, and who better to friend than people you share common interests with? So join as many clubs and organizations as your time permits.
</p>
<h3>Learn The Customs</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
	India's a very different place, and the general notion is - anything goes. However this is not the case in America. Realize that you're representing your country through your behaviour. Being polite and gentle is the norm, but the thing most Indians struggle with is keeping our mouths closed while eating. This practice, although suitable for eating Indian food, is a huge no-no here.
</p>
<h3>Explore Opportunities</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
	After coming here I made the fatal mistake of not exploring the opportunities given to me. I missed numerous job opportunities and research offers. Hence, don't make the mistake that I made and look for opportunities in your major. Talk to professors, ask to do independent study, and be on a lookout for interesting events. 
</p>
<h3>Don't Forget to Have Fun</h3>
<hr/>
<p>
	Remember that although this is a new experience, don't forget to have fun. If you are like most people, you will probably go to college once, and this is one of the best time of your life, and take full advantage of the fact that you're in a brand new place.
