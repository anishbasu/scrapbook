Studying in the US was one of my childhood dreams. When I was a kid, I was inspired by the likes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Larry Page and Sergey Brin – all college dropouts. I always wondered -  what is so different about American colleges that it produces these risk takers, innovators, and creators of a new society? I didn’t just want to read about it, so I set about to explore US college admissions and finally after about 4 years of preparing and wound up at Drexel doing a Bachelor’s/Master’s in Computer Science. I’d never lived alone for an extended period of time before and I was really excited to experience this new situation. So, after 2 months, I am writing about my experiences in the country I wanted to be a part of since the beginning of time.

I am a pretty average Indian guy that comes from a middle class family, just like most of you that are reading this. I hope this piece will motivate you enough to come study here. The idea that studying here is really expensive has been really blown out of proportion – don’t take “advice” from uncles and aunties about coming here, everyone survives and generally pays off their loans within five years.

From an Indian context, the opportunities that I have received just after being here for 2 months is greater than the total number of opportunities that I received by staying in India for 18 years. The thing that I discovered was that every door is open if you can try enough. Being away from your family and friends, it really gets you out of the comfort zone and you feel the urge of trying out new things. Suddenly the world seems much smaller, and travel to previously “faraway” places merely a game of being confident enough to go there. This unbounded freedom comes with a lot of responsibilities, something Indian children are generally not taught about. For the first time, I felt real happiness after completing my daily responsibilities.

However, one must keep in mind that money is something you need to be careful about when you shop for things. When I arrived is the United States, I would convert every price in dollars to rupees, and since a dollar is equivalent to 70 rupees, I almost starved to death within the first week of coming here. What I did learn is when you’re spending in dollars, spend in dollars, and don’t bother converting the price to your local currency, because the price is just going to give you a heart attack because you’re used to things being way cheaper. The simplest trick I use while shopping for things is that I always remember the price of 1 bottle of bottled water and compare the price ($1.50) to whatever I am thinking of purchasing. It gives me a perspective on the price of the item without making me rely on my old habits of converting everything to rupees and starving to death.

I used the webpage format to create my scrapbook because I walk to a lot of places within Philadelphia and tend to travel outside Philadelphia for various events during the weekends, and while on the trips, I tend to take a lot of pictures, mostly depicting the scenery in front of me. I’m really quite terrible at describing the scenery, and it has always been said that a picture speaks a thousand words. So, rather than describing what the place looks like, I can actually use images to pictorially represent the place. Making it a webpage also gives me a certain amount of freedom to make it interactive, for example a map would allow me to pinpoint where I was when I took the picture or experienced a particular event.

This semi-journal scrapbook recounts the experiences that I've had over the first few months here in the United States. Thanks for reading this and enjoy the pieces of memories that lay ahead.
