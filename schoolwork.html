<h1>Schoolwork</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
	You'll probably find schoolwork in college much more demanding than the schoolwork that you did in school. The schoolwork here will not test your retention skills, but will rather test your application of concepts learned in class. I really like doing coursework here because I'm a knesthetic learner, and the coursework seems to directly affect me.

<p>
	However, it's important to manage expectations and do your best. Remember, college is for learning, and use it to the fullest. Drexel moves very fast, and a snowflake of homework can quickly turn into a snowball of missed deadlines and a whole lot crying. To avoid that, you can follow the following tips that I've learnt this quarter.

<ul>

	<li><strong>Conquer</strong> Do the tasks you have listed and cross them out one by one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scheduling</h2>
<p>Scheduling is an important thing that most of us never think to do, because, let's be honest, it's kind of boring and repititive. I mean, who wants to make their schedule everyday? However, allocating time to every one of your responsibilities throughout the day has made me more accountable to myself, and therefore more productive.

<h3>Creating A Schedule that's Simple</h3>
<p>
	Everyone can make a schedule, right? It's that kinda thing that you think that you can do, but it never works. Expectations never really match reality. You might have some sort of important meeting that crops up during some other activity that you wanted to do, and now the schedule goes out of the window. I will describe a schedule creation method that welcomes distractions.

	<strong>Materials Needed:</strong> A Calendar, A piece of paper
</div>
<ul>
	<li>Make 2 columns named <strong>Today</strong>, <strong>Later</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Beginning of Day: </strong> Take 5 minutes to fill out what you need to do that day in this format: <i>Time - Thing</i></li>
	<li>As you go throughout the day, keep crossing events off the list</li>
	<li>As you encounter new events, schedule them into the <strong>Later</strong> column</li>
	<li>If you have to override a scheduled event, jot the scheduled event in the <strong>Later </strong> column.</li>
	<li><strong>End of Day: </strong> Put the events in the <strong>Later</strong> column in the Calendar.</li>
</ul>
