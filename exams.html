<h1>Exams</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
Let's be honest, <strong>no one likes examinations.</strong> I mean, you're supposed to display the entirity of what you've learnt over the course of 3/6/12 months in a 3 hour exam? That sounds frankly ridiculous. However, many universities still hold exams for several of their classes. You just have to endure them, but here are some things I've learnt by taking 2 midterms in 3 months here at Drexel. Classes move fast and exams are almost outside your door all the time.

<h2>Taking Notes</h2>
<p>
	Taking good notes in class is an invaluable tool for exam preparation. I tried a lot of different types of note taking, but I found that the Cornell note taking method is the most effective for taking definition heavy notes. However, I also realised that paper is costly and started to take all my notes on my laptop. Turns out, taking math notes on my laptop are really hard to take, but I use a program called LyX that uses a special sort of langauge called LaTeX to store mathematical expressions.

<h3>Cornell Note-Taking Method</h3>
<p>
	So the Cornell method for note taking is really easy, and generally works really well for taking definition heavy notes. The main selling point of this note taking method is that it's really easy to make flash cards out of them.

<h4>Preparing Notes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Make 2 columns on a blank sheet of paper, going upto 6/7th of the sheet. One column should have 1/3rd of the width and the other should have 2/3rd of the of the paper. </li>
	<li> The smaller column is used to write the term/question which is defined in the larger column.</li>
	<li>The little space on the bottom is used to summarize the notes taken in the entire sheet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prioritizing Exams and Quizzes</h2>
<p>
	See, every point counts, but sometimes you just have to prioritize what you do. I recommend looking at the syllabus. If you have a quiz that accounts for 10% of 25% of the total grade and you have an exam that accounts for 50% of the total grade, definitely prepare for the exam more than the quiz. The thing to know about quizzes is that they are for you to test your knowledge about the subject and brush up on the topics you might be missing.
