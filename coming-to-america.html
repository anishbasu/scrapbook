<h1>Coming to America</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
It was the <strong>8<sup>th</sup> of September, 2015</strong>. I distinctly remember the last moments when I left my house. There were three cars right out in front and all my friends, relatives -- everyone I cared about hopped on these cars and we were off!

A multitude of feelings rushed by. I had fought hard to come here, fought with my parents, my immediate family. I had fought notions that I couldn't make it, but I finally did it. I actually really did come to America.
</p>
<p>
Amidst numerous phone calls wishing me a happy journey, I felt a strange sensation, I felt as if this were not at all true, merely a dream disguising itself as the truth. The reality of the situation hit me when I arrived at the Dumdum Airport's International Terminal. I departed with the many farewells from my family and friends.

I took a four hour flight from Dumdum to Hong Kong. It was uneventful flight, but it was my maiden journey on an airplane. I was so excited when the plane took off. The first few moments on the airplane was very unnerving at first but sleep quickly took over and the rest of the night passed away without a hitch.

At 7:30 AM HKT, we landed on Hong Kong Airport. The airport was situated on an island and the view of the airport was spectacular. However, I had only an hour of time to change flights, and I couldn't experience the amenities offered.
</p>
<p>
It was 9 AM HKT when I boarded my flight from Hong Kong to New York. The flight was 18 hours long, and I was very bored and tired from sleeping upright in my seat. The journey was really harrowing and I think it put me off flying anywhere. I did, however, experience 2 sunrises, which was a really great experience. I got to live September 9th twice before landing in the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York at 1:50 PM EST.

<p>Lost in New York is something many people can relate with, and this happened to me on the very first time I boarded a cab in New York. The cab driver couldn't find my cousin's house so we spent 4 hours going about the length and breadth of Manhattan. Finally, after going through most places dropping other people off, I reached my destination. I must tell you, I felt so relieved when I reached my cousin's apartment. They had a wonderful view of Times Square from their window. They told about some of the things that American people expect from other people, like being polite at all times, and acting courteously.
