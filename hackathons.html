<h1>Hackathons</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
	Hackathons are basically what anyone would call programming competitions, but of a different sort. They are coding marathons where teams of 4 people sit down for an extended period of time (24 to 36 hours generally) to create solutions to real life problems.
</p>
<h2>Why should I care?</h2>
<p>
	I don't know if you will agree with me or not, but sitting down with an idea and coming out with a product seems like a great idea to me. If that does not appeal to you, there are prizes worth thousands of dollars given out to the winners of the Hackathons every week of the year. In fact the <strong>Like</strong> button on Facebook that is so prevelant these days was made at a Facebook Hackathon.

<h2>My experience with Hackathons</h2>

	So one of the reasons I wanted to come to America was Hackathons. They're massive recruiting events, and the connections made at Hackathons go a long way. The prizes are really great, and having won twice, I must say that they are a really really lucrative way for people to make serious cash.

	I usually hang out with my two friends Mridul and Shantanu. Mridul is a freshman who I knew since Junior year although we stayed quite far away. Shantanu is a Junior, and is relatively more experienced than us. So one Friday evening during our regular chat we thought it would be a good idea to attend one of the Hackathon events that were happening near us. We chose HackRU as it was relatively near at New Brunswick, NJ. We were pumped because it was our first hackathon.

	Saturday, we rose, groggy eyed, and we boarded the SEPTA to New Brunswick, which was my first train ride. The length of the trains were similar to the Metros we have in Kolkata, except with front facing seats. The train ride passed uneventfully, with me working on the English Discussion Posts. We then got off at Trenton, changed trains to New Brunswick, and soon we landed in New Brunswick, and were greeted by nearby panhandlers asking for money. After answering in the negative, we hailed a cab that took us to the Rutgers Auditorium, where the event was being held.

	We were greeted by the hackathon organizers, and were told to sign in to the event so that they can order food accordingly. We signed in, and found a place to sit. We then visited the various sponsors that were funding the event, and in turn received a ton of free stuff like T-Shirts to take back home and wear to every English Class.
</p>
<p>
	The event began with Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++ giving a keynote presentation on why it is important to innovate. We then went went down to code, but we didn't have a clue what to do. Finally after 2 hours, Mridul came up with an idea. How about we make a Kinect based tracking algorithms to detect Tibial Arthrosis in infants? Tibial Arthrosis is very hard to diagnose, and doctors are usually prevented from taking X-Rays of children by the FDA for assumed cases of Tibial Arthrosis.

	Shantanu was the guy that really brought the project together, and we tested it on the contestants at HackRU and it was (thankfully) a success. The judges loved our innovative solution to an intractable and we won the first prize at HackRU.
