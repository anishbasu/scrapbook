<h1>Move-In</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
	After staying in my cousin's house for 2 days, I went to my uncle's house in Bryn Mawr, PA. My uncle is also a professor here at Drexel, so it seemed like a reasonable thing to do. So, on the morning of September 11th, 2015, I bought a Bolt Bus ticket from West 33rd Street and 22nd Avenue, New York to Philadelphia 30th Street Station. My cousins had work in the morning so I was left alone. I ate a very American Breakfast which consisted of every item picked from the dollar menu.
</p><p>
	I left my cousin's house at 11:30 AM, after taking a long, hot shower. I met a cab driver, who promised to take me to the Bus Station with my two heavy luggages. During our journey to the destination, he revealed that he was in fact Bangladeshi, and we talked about the immigration system, and he showed me the pictures of his children. I found out that the American Dream is in fact in the bones of everyone who beats their odds of failure to come here to settle in this wonderful mixing pot of culture. He said that although he is a cab driver, he was a student at NYU Poly, doing his Masters in Electrical Engineering. He said that although he liked to drive cabs, he realized quite late that he had a passion for electronics, and hence enrolled himelf in the program. However, he dropped me 3 miles from my destination, and I had to lug my luggage for 3 miles, which was a difficult ordeal.
</p>
<p>
	The day was mildly rainy, and after lugging my things for 3 miles, I was tired. The place looked very seedy, and I wanted to rest. However, the gods had pther plans. After I reached the bus stop, I was notified that I had to wait for an extra 30minutes in the rain because the bus hadn't arrived from Philadelphia yet. So, after the 30 min wait, we went on the bus and the rest of the journey went smoothly.

	I arrived in sunny Philadelphia after a 2 hour bus ride and found my Uncle waiting for me with his car. As I hopped on the car, he asked me, "কিছু খেয়েছ ? America কেমন লাগছে? আমরা তোমার জন্য কতক্ষণ অপেক্ষা করছিলাম। দেরী হল কেন ?"  <i>(Have you eaten anything? How are you finding this place? We were waiting for you for so long, why were you late?)</i>. I answered in the affirmative, that yes, I already had eaten before boarding the bus. I also had to explain that I was late because the bus was a wee bit late.
</p>
<p>
	After everything was said and done, we drove to my Uncle's beautiful house in the suburbs. After going inside, I saw that their house looked exactly like the houses that I'd seen in TV so many times. After having a quick snack consisting of sandwiches and dill, we went out to roam around the area. We visited the Bryn Mawr College, where I met my old friend Sanjana who studies there. We then went to a bank to create an account in my name.
</p>
<p>
	The next day, September 12th, was the move-in day for freshmen, and my Uncle and Aunt drove me to Drexel, where the suthorities had set up a really smooth way to move in people from all over the world. It consisted of signing in at the 30th Street Station Parking lot, and then taking your tag and driving up to the dorms, where expert movers would take your things and put them inside your rooms. After my luggage was removed from the car, my uncle and aunt bid me goodbye and drove away.
</p>
<p>
	And thus began my journey into a foreign land.
